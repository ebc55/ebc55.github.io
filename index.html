  <h1 id="MYSTORY"> ELLA CAGGIANO: <br> MY STORY <h1>

    <div>
    <p id="fitstory">
My fitness story is not a linear one. Growing up, I always struggled with maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Whether it was overeating, undereating, over exercising, or not exercising at all... I’ve done it all. It took me a long time to find that balance. One of the main causes of this was the amount of BS on the internet! There is so much "health and fitness" information out there that is not only false, but can be extremely damaging to the mental and physical health of others. <br>
It wasn’t until I discovered weight training and learned more about nutrition that everything changed for me. Learning how to lift and exercise properly was one of the best things in propelling my fitness journey. I once saw food as an inhibitor for fat loss, I now see it as the essential fuel for my body’s growth and recovery. I'm here to break the stigma around mental health as it relates to one's fitness journey. It IS possible to love yourself AND want to get better! There is a healthy balance between those things.

Training doesn't look the same for everyone: Your fitness routine should fit your goals, lifestyle, and time constraints. My training plan changes based on my current project. My current training plan is powerlifting focused, because I am on a plan given to me from the UPowerlifting team at the University of Miami. <br>
My diet is very flexible. I like to focuses on whole, nutritent desnse foods, and high protein, but that doesn't mean that all I eat is chicken and broccoli. I am a huge believer in not labeling foods "good" and "bad," and that everything is fine in moderation. Food is something that should be enjoyed: It is the focus point of many social activities, it brings people together, mot to mention it tastes great. Life is too short to restrict yourself to the stereotypical "health" foods, and while those may be good for your body, foods like icecream are good for your mind and soul, which contributes to holistic health.
<br>
I am not a certified personal trainer, and all of the programs I have created are based on my own personal experiences, trails/errors, mistakes, and successes. If you are looking for a program that is <strong> professionally </strong> designed to fit your personal needs and goals, please contact a certified trainer or your doctor.

  <h1 id="MENTALHEALTH"> LET'S TALK ABOUT HEALTH: MENTAL AND PHYSICAL </h1>
  <p id="mentalhealth">
I believe that in order to be fully <strong>healthy</strong> you must have a grasp on not only your physical health, but your mental health as well. All aspects of health are interrelated: Your physical wellbeing has direct correlation on your mood, energy, and general wellbeing. Working on your overall health does not just mean regular exercise. It means sleeping right, eating right, practice mental health exercises, and making your free time productive and valuable. Prioritizing all aspects of your health will lead to longevity and a higher quality of life.
