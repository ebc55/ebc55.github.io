<h1> MY MORNING ROUTINE </h1>
</header>

<main>

<h1>WAKE UP</h1>
<p>The time I wake up changes from day-to-day, and I wish I could say I wake up at 5am every morning ready to take on the day... but that simply isn't true. The life of a college student is that I wake up with enough time to get my morning routine done before my classes.</p>

<h1>MAKE MY BED</h1>
<p>Studies show that making your bed in the morning makes your day more productive. You have already accomplished something in the morning when you make your bed, and you are ready to take the day my storm.</p>

<h1>PLAN MY DAY</h1>
<p>
I have been really into bullet journaling recently, and I am not perfect at it, but it has been a huge part of my daily routine. Every day I pull out my bullet journal
